    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Tech Lead/Senior Software Engineer and Professional Scrum Master with nearly 10 years experience mainly as a back-end engineer, but with a sprinkling of full-stack exposure. Through my roles to date I have had worked in the payments, eCommerce and scientific research domains.

      Most recently I have been working on cloud native stacks, making use of Kotlin, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, AWS (MySQL aurora, SNS & SQS, DynamoDB and others), Terraform, GitHub Actions, Prometheus and more. In the past I have also had limited experience with Angular and C#/ASP.NET.

      I may be a relatively recent convert to TDD, but I've forever been a whole hearted believer in "If it's not tested, it's not 'done' and it doesn't work" and am always an advocate for my teams increasing their automated test coverage throughout the testing pyramid. Whichever career level I've been at I have also always been active in trying to improve team's development practices and processes.
