career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Senior Software Engineer and Professional Scrum Master with over 7 years experience mainly as a back-end developer, but with a sprinkling of full-stack exposure. Through my roles to date I have had exposure to the scientific research, e-commerce and payments domains.

      Most recently I have been working on cloud native stacks, making use of Spring Boot, Angular, Kubernetes, Kafka, AWS (Redis elasticache, PostgreSQL RDS, MySQL aurora, SQS and others), Terraform, Jenkins, BuildKite and more.

      I am whole hearted believer in "If it's not tested, it doesn't work" and am always an advocate for my teams increasing their automated test coverage throughout the testing pyramid.
education:
    - degree: BSc in Computer Science with Industrial Placement
      university: University of Birmingham
      time: 2011 - 2015
      result: 1st
experiences:
    - role: Software Engineer
      time: May 2021 - Present
      company: Tyro, Sydney, Australia
      details: |
        After a year of on and off UK lockdowns I had the unmissable opportunity to migrate to Australia, where I joined Tyro to work on their payments solutions.

        I am based in one of the backend "Money-In, Money-Out" teams who own the main integration between Tyro and the Australian Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) used to transfer funds to Tyro's merchants. We also own the services responsible for invoicing our merchants for Tyro's services. This team has been my first exposure to 100% pair programming and also red, green, refactor based TDD.

        As Tyro are still ramping up their cloud migration I have been able to use experience from previous roles to help guide their microservices architecture. I have been commended for always conveying these past experiences as constructive advice rather than trying to enforce a specific solution.

        Technologies: Kotlin, Java 8, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, Prometheus, AWS SQS, Terraform, MySQL (AWS Aurora), Git and BuildKite
    - role: Senior Software Developer
      time: Apr 2019 - Apr 2021
      company: SAP, Maidenhead, UK
      details: |
        Having been promoted to a Senior Developer I took a more prominent role in designing and architecting solutions, including migrating the Customer Recovery applications from Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes. This was mainly around dockerising our applications and producing their Kubernetes and Istio resources.

        In May 2020 our team was moved from the Context Driven Services product to the Upscale Commerce product. I quickly got up to speed with the product as a whole and the areas of the product our team was to be responsible for, allowing me to help drive designs and architectures to best support new features.

        In this role I have also been keen to use my experience in agile teams to identify improvements to ways or working of teams across Upscale Commerce. To be formalise my experience I attained my Professional Scrum Master certification from Scrum.org.

        Technologies: Java 11, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, Kafka, Istio, Prometheus, Angular, cypress, Karate, PostgreSQL (AWS RDS and Aurora), Redis (AWS elasticache), Git, Bamboo, and Jenkins
    - role: Software Developer
      time: Jan 2018 - Apr 2019
      company: SAP, Maidenhead, UK
      details: |
        This was my first role working on truly cloud native architectures where I was designing and developing Spring Boot microservices and Angular frontends deployed to Cloud Foundry, utilising AWS backing services.

        Over this first year in the team I became regarded as a senior member of the team and this was recognised by my manager who put me forward for a promotion to Senior Developer.

        A year into my two year graduate scheme at STFC I successfully interviewed for a position as the team lead for the Proposals & Outcomes team within my group.

      company: STFC, Harwell, UK

        In my first commercial software development experience I was fortunate to join a small team responsible for all phases of the software development lifecycle, so gained a solid grounding in what it mean to be part of a professional software development team.
