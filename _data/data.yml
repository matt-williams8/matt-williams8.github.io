career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Senior Software Engineer and Professional Scrum Master with over 6 years experience mainly as a back-end developer, but with a healthy amount of full-stack exposure.

      Most recently I have been working on cloud native stacks, making use of Spring Boot, Angular, Kubernetes, Kafka, AWS (Redis elasticache, PostgreSQL RDS and others), Jenkins and more.
      The majority of my day-to-day work has been focused in the Spring Boot back-end services and their deployment to Kubernetes, but I'm not scared to get involved in the front-end!

      I am whole hearted beleiver in the phrase "If it's not tested, it doesn't work" and am always an advocate for my teams increasing their automated test coverage throughout the testing pyramid.

experiences:
    - role: Senior Software Developer
      time: Apr 2019 - Present
      company: SAP, Maidenhead, UK
      details: |
        Having been promoted to a Senior Developer I took a more prominent role in designing and architecting solutions, including migrating the Customer Recovery applications from Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes. This was mainly around producing our Kubernetes and Istio resources (cluster setup and core service mesh configuration was handled by another team).

        In May 2020 our team was moved from the Context Driven Services product to the Upscale Commerce product. I quickly got up to speed with the product as a whole and the areas of the product our team was to be responsible for, allowing me to help drive designs and architectures to best support new features.

        In this role I have also been keen to use my experience in agile teams to identify improvements to ways or working of teams across Upscale Commerce. To be formalise my experience I attained my Professional Scrum Master certification from Scrum.org.

        Day-to-day technologies used: Java 11, Spring Boot, Cloud Foundry, Kafka, Angular, cypress, Karate, PostgreSQL (AWS RDS and Aurora), Redis (AWS elasticache), Git, Bamboo, and Jenkins
    - role: Software Developer
      time: Jan 2018 - Apr 2019
      company: SAP, Maidenhead, UK
      details: |
        This was my first role working on truly cloud native architectures where I was designing and developing Spring Boot microservices and Angular frontends deployed to Cloud Foundry, utilising AWS backing services.

        During this first year in the team I gradually became regarded as a more and more senior member of the team. After the first few months I found that senior engineers were coming to bounce ideas off me with increasing frequency. This was recognised by my manager who put me forward for a promotion to Senior Engineer in December (effective from April).

        Day-to-day technologies used: Java 8, Spring Boot, Cloud Foundry, Kafka, Angular, cypress, PostgreSQL (AWS RDS), Redis (AWS elasticache), Git, and Bamboo
    - role: Software Engineer (Proposals & Outcomes team lead)
      time: Aug 2016 - Dec 2017
      company: Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Harwell, UK
      details: |
        Designing, creating, maintaining and supporting software systems for a world leading research facility.

        A year into my two year graduate scheme at STFC I successfully interviewed for a position as the team lead for the Proposals & Outcomes team within my group.

        This role had me much more involved in the project and programme management of the various systems my team and group were responsible for. I regularly met with senior managers in other departments to discuss their requirements for new features or systems.

        As a team lead I also gained exposure to line management and line managed up to 4 staff including apprentices, placement students and full-time staff.

        Day-to-day technologies used: Java 7 EE, C#/.NET 4.5, JavaScript, Oracle SQL, Glassfish/Payara, IIS, Git, and Jenkins
    - role: Graduate Software Engineer 
      time: Aug 2015 - Aug 2016
      company: STFC, Harwell, UK
      details: |
        After undertaking my placement year with STFC I was awarded a place on the Student Sponsorship scheme and after completing my degree I progressed through the scheme into a position as a Graduate Software Engineer.
    - role: Placement Student Software Engineer
      time: Jul 2013 - Jul 2014
      company: STFC, Harwell, UK
      details: |
        In my first commercial software development experience I was fortunate to join a small team responsible for all phases of the software development lifecycle, so gained a solid grounding in what it mean to be part of a professional software development team.
